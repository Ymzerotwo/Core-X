# 🪵 Logger Configuration
# =============================================================================

# 1. Environment Mode
# - development: Logs are printed to the console with colors for readability.
# - production: Logs are written to files only (performance optimization).
NODE_ENV=development

# 2. Service Name
# This name appears in every log entry. Useful for distinguishing between
# multiple services if you aggregate logs centrally.
SERVICE_NAME=Core-X-Backend

# 3. Log Level
# Defines the minimum severity level to record.
# Priority order: error (0) > warn (1) > info (2) > http (3) > verbose (4) > debug (5)
# - debug: Logs everything (use for local development).
# - http: Logs API requests and errors (recommended for staging).
# - info: Logs important events and errors only (recommended for production).
LOG_LEVEL=debug

# 4. Force Console Logging (Optional)
# Set to 'true' to enable console output even in 'production' mode.
# Useful for debugging containers (e.g., Docker logs).
ENABLE_CONSOLE_LOGS=false
